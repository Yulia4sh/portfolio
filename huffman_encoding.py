Title: Huffman Encoding and Decoding

Description:
This script implements the Huffman encoding algorithm for compressing strings and decoding them back to their original form. The script includes the following functionalities:

1. encode_huffman(input_str): Encodes the input string using the Huffman algorithm. It also calculates and prints the average length of encoded characters and verifies McMillan's inequality.
2. decode(encoded_str, code_dict): Decodes a Huffman encoded string using the provided code dictionary.

Requirements:
- Python 3.x
