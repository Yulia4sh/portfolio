Title: Taper Formula Visualization

Description:
This script uses the Taper formula to graphically represent both the Taper formula itself and a given name. 
It consists of the following functionalities:

1. find_k(name): Determines the constant 'k' based on a binary image. It converts a binary image (106 Ã— 17) to a binary string, calculates its decimal equivalent, and multiplies by 17.
2. black_square(x, y): Draws a black square at the specified (x, y) coordinates using the turtle library.
3. tapper(x, y): Calculates the value of the Taper function at a given (x, y) position.
4. f(k): Uses the Taper formula to form an image based on the constant 'k' by drawing squares on the turtle canvas.

Requirements:
- Pillow (PIL) library for image processing.
- Turtle graphics library for drawing.

Usage:
- Provide binary images named "0.png" and "0(0).png" to visualize their representations using the Taper formula.
